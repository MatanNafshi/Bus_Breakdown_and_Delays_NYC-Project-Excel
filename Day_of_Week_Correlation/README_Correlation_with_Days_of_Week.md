# Correlation Between Specific Days of the Week and the Frequency of Breakdowns or Delays

## Breakdown Correlation with Day of the Week
The analysis identified that the frequency of breakdowns shows a gradual decrease throughout the week, with a peak on Mondays. This could be attributed to higher usage early in the week and potential vehicle issues carried over from the weekend.

### Findings:
- **Highest Breakdown Frequency**: Occurs on Mondays, with gradual decreases through the week.
- **Recommendation**: Schedule preventive maintenance over weekends to reduce breakdowns during the week.

## Running Late Correlation with Day of the Week
Delays tend to spike on Mondays and gradually decrease toward Friday. The cause of these delays is often linked to traffic, which could be mitigated by adjusting bus schedules to avoid peak traffic hours.

- **Spike in Delays**: Delays are highest on Mondays and decrease by Friday.
- **Conclusion**: The decline in delays by Friday may be linked to reduced traffic as fewer people commute to work. Adjusting bus schedules to avoid peak times may reduce delays further.
