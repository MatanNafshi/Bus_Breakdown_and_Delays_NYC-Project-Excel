## Step 1: Initial Data Cleaning
The first step of data cleaning involved identifying and removing duplicate entries, as well as handling missing or inconsistent data. This ensured that the analysis was based on a clean and accurate dataset, free of redundancy or incorrect values.

### Actions Taken:
- Removed duplicate rows to ensure that each delay or breakdown was only recorded once.
- Identified and handled missing values, ensuring the integrity of the data for analysis.

## Step 2: Formatting and Consistency
The second phase of cleaning focused on ensuring consistent data formats across columns, particularly in borough and bus company names. This standardization was essential to avoid discrepancies when analyzing delays by borough or bus company.
