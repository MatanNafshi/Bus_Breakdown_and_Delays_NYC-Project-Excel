# Bus Breakdown and Delays NYC Project

This project analyzes bus breakdowns and delays in New York City using Excel for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis. The goal is to identify common reasons for delays and breakdowns, and to propose recommendations to reduce their occurrence.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on key aspects of bus delays in NYC:
- **Common Delay Reasons**: Identifying the most frequent causes of delays and breakdowns.
- **Running Late Correlation**: Investigating how delays correlate with the day of the week and traffic conditions.
- **Breakdown Trends**: Analyzing breakdown patterns and proposing maintenance schedules to mitigate them.
- **Delay Times by Borough**: Understanding how delay times vary across different boroughs and bus companies.

## Visualizations and Findings

### Common Reasons for Delays and Breakdowns

- **Findings**: Mechanical problems and "Won’t Start" issues are the top causes of breakdowns. Preventive maintenance is recommended to address these recurring mechanical failures.

### Running Late Reasons

- **Findings**: Heavy traffic is overwhelmingly the main cause of delays. A potential solution is adjusting bus schedules to avoid peak traffic hours.

### Running Late Correlation with Day of the Week

- **Findings**: There’s a noticeable spike in delays on Mondays and a decrease on Fridays, likely due to changing traffic patterns. Adjustments to schedules during these days could reduce delays.

### Breakdown Correlation with Day of the Week

- **Findings**: Breakdowns occur most frequently on Mondays, with a steady decrease throughout the week. Scheduling more maintenance over weekends could help reduce breakdowns.

### Delays by Borough

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning was essential for ensuring accuracy in analysis. Below are the cleaning steps and initial data explorations:
- **Cleaning 1**: Removing duplicates and handling missing data.

## Conclusion

This project identified the most common reasons for bus breakdowns and delays in NYC. Key insights include the impact of traffic on delays and the prevalence of mechanical issues as the main cause of breakdowns. Recommendations include targeted maintenance schedules, especially over weekends, and adjustments to bus routes and timings to avoid traffic congestion.
